# Changelog

## [6.0.0](https://github.com/thunder/thunder-distribution/tree/6.0.0) 2020-07-27

Add Drupal 9 compatibility. To achieve this, we had to remove the AMP anf Facebook instant articles modules. If you need
these modules, you have to stay on Thunder 3.5 (Drupal 8.9) for now. Thunder 3.5 will be supported as long as Drupal 8.9
is supported. Drupal 8.9 Support will end in November 2021.

For update instructions from Thunder 3 to Thunder 6 see the [Thunder 6 update documentation](https://thunder.github.io/thunder-documentation/update-3-to-6)

What happened to Thunder 4 and 5? Drupal.org introduced semantic versioning, and what we considered to be Thunder 3.4 and Thunder 3.5
is Thunder 4 and Thunder 5 in drupal.org terms. So we had to do the big version jump to Thunder 6.
