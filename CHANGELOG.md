# Changelog

## [6.5.1](https://github.com/thunder/thunder-distribution/tree/6.5.1) 2023-01-19

Adding Entity Browser patch for SA-CONTRIB-2023-002. We cannot update entity browser, so we have to backport the patch.
Our Entity Browser will still be shown as vulnerable, but it is fixed with this patch.

## [6.5.0](https://github.com/thunder/thunder-distribution/tree/6.5.0) 2023-01-05

Minor release, that bumps the Drupal core dependency to 9.5.x.
