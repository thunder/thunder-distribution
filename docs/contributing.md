# Contribute to Thunder

Thunder is a "Drupal" based distribution.

We are working on GitHub and drupal.org. Issues are managed on drupal.org. That gives us the possibility to better
interact with related issues. Code improvements will be managed over GitHub's PR system.

If you found an issue with Thunder, please open a
[ticket](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/thunder?categories=All) on drupal.org. Please have in mind that Thunder
is a collection of Drupal modules, a set of configurations, and very little custom code.

So, if you can track down an issue to a specific module, please open the ticket in the corresponding issue queue on
drupal.org.

If you want to open a PR for the Thunder distribution, please make sure you created a corresponding issue on d.o.
before. All created pull requests should contain a d.o. issue number in its title.

Please also note the pull request template to create better quality pull requests.

## Setup Thunder for development

To install the Thunder Distribution for development create the thunder-develop project:

```bash
composer create-project thunder/thunder-develop -s dev
cd thunder-develop
```

This will install thunder into the docroot folder. The actual distribution repository will be cloned into
docroot/profiles/contrib/thunder.

Now you can install thunder. Point the web server to the docroot directory and do a normal site install.

To work on the distribution, work inside the docroot/profiles/contrib/thunder folder.

```bash
cd docroot/profiles/contrib/thunder
git checkout -b feature/new-thunder-feature # <-- this will be a branch in the distribution not the project
<make changes>
git commit .
```

## Automated code checks

All Thunder pull requests are executed on [GitHub actions](https://github.com/thunder/thunder-distribution/actions). On
every pull request tests will be executed (or when new commits are pushed into the pull request branch). All code will
be checked against coding style.

We support some test execution options. They can be provided by pull request labels. Here is a list of supported labels:

- *test-upgrade* - this option will execute a custom test path, where an update (including the execution of update
  hooks) from Thunder 2 will be tested. This option should be used in case of a pull request with update hooks or module
  updates.
- *test-min* - this option installs the pull request version of Thunder with the oldest possible dependencies and
  executes the test suite.
- *test-performance* - this option pushed the codebase to our performance testing infrastructure. A successful test-max
  build is required for this.

## How-To's

### Update profile configuration

The Thunder distribution ships the config_profile module as a dev dependency for easier config updates. The workflow for
updating config files that are shipped in the distribution should be:

- Install the latest dev version of Thunder
- Enable the Config Profile module

  ```bash
  drush en config_profile
  ```

- Apply all your changes in the UI
- Export your configuration

  ```bash
  drush cex
  ```

  The configuration is exported to the chosen config_directory and simultaneously to your profile folder.
- config_profile has now copied all the config changes to the profile folder
- Put all new config files to the desired folder and add track it in git
- Remove all untracked files

  ```bash
  git clean -fd
  ```

### Writing update hooks

To support the creation of update hooks, Thunder integrated the `update_helper` module. That contains several methods to
e.g. update the existing configuration or enabling modules.

Outputting results of update hook is highly recommended for that we have provided UpdateLogger, it handles the output of
result properly for `drush` or UI (`update.php`) update workflow. That's why every update hook that changes something
should log what is changed and was it successful or it has failed. And the last line in the update hook should be
returning of UpdateLogger output. UpdateLogger service is also used by Thunder Updater and it can be retrieved from it.
Here are two examples of how to get and use UpdateLogger. All text logged as INFO, will be outputted as success
in `drush` output.

```php
  // Get service directly.
  /** @var \Drupal\update_helper\UpdateLogger $updateLogger */
  $updateLogger = \Drupal::service('update_helper.logger');

  // Log change success or failures.
  if (...) {
    $updateLogger->info('Change is successful.');
  }
  else {
    $updateLogger->warning('Change has failed.');
  }

  // At end of update hook return result of UpdateLogger::output().
  return $updateLogger->output();
```

Other way to get UpdateLogger is from Update Helper Updater service.

```php
  // Get service from Thunder Updater service.
  /** @var \Drupal\update_helper\Updater $updater */
  $updater = \Drupal::service('update_helper.updater');
  $updateLogger = $updater->logger();

  ...

  // At end of update hook return result of UpdateLogger::output().
  return $updateLogger->output();
```

#### Importing new configurations

You have to create configuration update definition file with global `import_configs` action. For example:

```yaml
__global:
  import_configs:
    - config.to.import
    - config.to.import-no2
```

After that you just have to execute configuration update. For example:

```php
  /** @var \Drupal\update_helper\Updater $updater */
  $updater = \Drupal::service('update_helper.updater');
  $updater->executeUpdate('thunder_article', 'thunder_update_8101');

  return $updater->logger()->output();
```

This update hook will import configurations, that are in a module or profile config directory.

#### Updating existing configuration (with manually defined configuration changes)

Before Drupal\update_helper\Updater::updateConfig() updates existing configuration, it could check the current values of
that config. That helps to leave the modified, existing configuration in a valid state.

```php
  // List of configurations that should be checked for existence.
  $expectedConfig['content']['field_url'] = [
    'type' => 'instagram_embed',
    'weight' => 0,
    'label' => 'hidden',
    'settings' => [
      'width' => 241,
      'height' => 313,
    ],
    'third_party_settings' => [],
  ];

  // New configuration that should be applied.
  $newConfig['content']['thumbnail'] = [
    'type' => 'image',
    'weight' => 0,
    'region' => 'content',
    'label' => 'hidden',
    'settings' => [
      'image_style' => 'media_thumbnail',
      'image_link' => '',
    ],
    'third_party_settings' => [],
  ];

  /** @var \Drupal\update_helper\Updater $updater */
  $updater = \Drupal::service('update_helper.updater');
  $updater->updateConfig('core.entity_view_display.media.instagram.thumbnail', $newConfig, $expectedConfig);
```

#### Updating existing configuration (with using of generated configuration changes)

With the Thunder Updater module, we have provided Drupal Console command that will generate update configuration
changes (it's called configuration update definition or CUD). Configuration update definition (CUD) will be stored
in `config/update` directory of the module and it can be easily executed with Thunder Updater.

Workflow to generate Thunder configuration update is following:

1. Make a clean install of the previous version of Thunder (version for which one you want to create configuration
   update). For example, if you are merging changes to `develop` branch, then you should install Thunder for that branch
2. When Thunder is installed, make code update (with code update also configuration files will be updated, but not
   active configuration in the database)
3. Execute update hooks if it's necessary (e.g. in a case when you have a module and/or core updates in your branch)
4. Now is a moment to generate Thunder configuration update code. For that, we have provided the following drush command:
   `drush generate configuration-update`. That command should be executed and there is some
   information that has to be filled, like module name where all generated data will be saved (CUD file,
   checklist `update.yml` and update hook function). Then also information for checklist entry, like title, success
   message, and failure message. Command will generate CUD file and save it in `config/update` folder of the module, it
   will add an entry in `update.yml` file for the checklist and it will create an update hook function
   in `<module_name>.install` file.
5. After the command has finished it will display what files are modified and generated. It's always good to make an
   additional check of generated code.

### Write automated tests

Thunder distribution comes with a set of Drupal tests. They can be used to validate Thunder installation or to use
provided traits for your own project Drupal tests.

### How to run the tests

Please see the official [Drupal documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/automated-testing/phpunit-in-drupal)

To speed up the test execution time, you can provide a database dump to Thunder tests:

```bash
cd docroot
php ./core/scripts/db-tools.php dump-database-d8-mysql | gzip > thunder.sql.gz
export thunderDumpFile=/path/to/thunder.sql.gz
```

### How to run the NightwatchJS performance tests <Badge type="danger" text="Not reviewed" vertical="bottom" />

1. You need to install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). Please check the installation documentation for it.
2. You have to install `thunder/thunder_performance_measurement` package. To do that, execute the following command in
   your project root directory: `composer require thunder/thunder_performance_measurement:dev-master --dev` and enable
   the module by executing: `drush en thunder_performance_measurement` in your `docroot` directory.
3. You need to install [Elastic APM Node.js Agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elastic-apm-node) in Drupal Core node
   packages. To do that go to your `docroot/core` directory and execute the following
   command: `yarn add elastic-apm-node --dev`
4. You have to adjust your `.env` file inside `docroot/core` directory. You can copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and
   edit it accordingly. Thunder tests require the following environment variables: `DRUPAL_TEST_BASE_URL`
   , `THUNDER_BRANCH`, `THUNDER_SITE_HOSTNAME` and `THUNDER_APM_URL`. The `THUNDER_BRANCH` is the branch name where
   tests are executing, for example, `8.x-4.x`. The `THUNDER_SITE_HOSTNAME` is the hostname where tests are executing,
   for example, `thunder.dev`. The `THUNDER_APM_URL` is URL to Elastic APM Server, for example, `http://localhost:8200`.
5. After that, you can run NightwatchJS tests by executing the following command inside `docroot/core`
   directory: `yarn test:nightwatch <path to JS Test file>`. Here is an
   example: `yarn test:nightwatch ../profiles/contrib/thunder/tests/src/Nightwatch/Tests/CreateMostUsedContent.js`

#### If you have a problem with outdated chromedriver

Drupal core does not update javascript dependencies so fast and chromedriver may be outdated and unable to work with
chrome installed on the system. You can provide chrome that can be used by chromedriver inside a docker container. You
can do it with the following command:

```bash
docker run --name selenium_chrome -d -P -p 6000:5900 -p 4444:4444 --shm-size 256m --add-host="thunder.dd:172.16.123.1" selenium/standalone-chrome-debug:3.141.59-selenium
```

You have to find what is correct docker image tag for the chrome version you need. To do that you have to take a look
at [selenium docker releases](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/releases). This workflow is similar to PHP
JavaScript tests and for additional information, you can take a look at **How to run the tests** section.

After you have running chrome in docker, you have also to change environment variables in `.env` file. The following
environment variable should be set:

```bash
DRUPAL_TEST_WEBDRIVER_PORT=4444
DRUPAL_TEST_WEBDRIVER_PATH_PREFIX=/wd/hub
DRUPAL_TEST_CHROMEDRIVER_AUTOSTART=false
```

You can copy/paste this section to the bottom of your `.env` file.

## Documentation

To help with the documentation, please run:

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:thunder/thunder-distribution.git
  cd thunder-distribution
  nvm use
  npm install
  npm run docs:dev
  ```

This will serve the docs server at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
