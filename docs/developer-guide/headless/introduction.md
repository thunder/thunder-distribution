# Introduction
The thunder_gqls module provides a GraphQL API schema and implementation for Thunder based on the Drupal GraphQL module
version 4.
Version 4 of the GraphQL module does not provide an out-of-the-box API for Drupal, as previous versions did. Instead, it
provides the ability to define a schema independent of the underlying Drupal installation, and utilities to map fields
defined in that schema to data from Drupal.

To get most of this documentation, you should have a basic understanding of what GraphQL is, and how to do requests
against GraphQL endpoints. A good starting point for this is the official
[GraphQl documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/).
