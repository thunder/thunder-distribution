We're developers, designers, strategists, coordinators, editors, translators, and more. Each year, we meet at DrupalCamps, meetups, and other events in more than 200 countries. But once a year, our community comes together at the biggest Drupal event in the world: DrupalCon North America. This year, from May 9-13, we'll be in New Orleans.</p>\n\n<h2>Make something amazing, for anyone</h2>\n\n<p>Bring your questions and challenges. At DrupalCon, you'll learn to make, think about, and do things differently with Drupal. There are <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/tracks\">13 session tracks</a>, featuring topics like UX, DevOps, project management, and PHP. And each track includes sessions for beginners, experts, and everyone between. You can also join full-day <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/summits\">summits</a> or choose from 15 <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/training\">training courses</a>. You'll leave New Orleans inspired and empowered to create amazing web experiences.</p>\n\n<h2>Introduce yourself</h2>\n\n<p>The best part of DrupalCon is the people you'll meet. Finally give a high-five to people you've only known by their Drupal.org username. Get great insight from industry leaders like Sara Wachter-Boettcher, and Drupal's founder, Dries Buytaert. Ask any of the 175 speakers the questions you've had about site building, case studies, and more. And as each conference day ends, the<a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/social-events\">events continue</a>. Join us at the opening reception, meet the Women in Drupal team, or test your knowledge on trivia night. Our community is excited to meet you.</p>\n\n<h2>Give back to the community</h2>\n\n<p>DrupalCon is an event where anyone can learn to use Drupal to make the internet a better place. And you won't have to wait until DrupalCon is over to use what you learn. Put your ideas to work right away at <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sprints\">sprints</a>. (Tip: you don't have to be a developer, or have ever joined a sprint before.) You can also help people feel welcome by having fun at <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/birds-feather\">Birds of a Feather sessions</a> (BoF's). Some BoF's—like last year's Knitting BoF—are all about the chance to create relationships.</p>\n\n<h2>Enjoy New Orleans</h2>\n\n<p>New Orleans has more than a few nicknames. But no matter what you call it, its history, culture, and people make it one of the most celebrated U.S. cities. <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/travel\">The convention center</a> is steps away from the famous French Quarter. It's also just a short ride away from the Garden District. There's more to explore than we can list.</p>"
