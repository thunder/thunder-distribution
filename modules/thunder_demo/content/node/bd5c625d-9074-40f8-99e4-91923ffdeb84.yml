No publisher in the world can do this alone, so we have to leave our historical silos behind, share our knowledge, cross traditional boundaries and learn how to work in a much more connected way. Thunder symbolizes this new era of collaboration: We have invested a lot of development effort, but we are not keeping the results for ourselves. We are putting it out there, to the core of our industry, so everyone can contribute to its continued enhancement. Our aim is to work with our partners to develop the best technology foundation for publishing the best journalistic content.”</p>\r\n"

At the core of the community is a team of publishing experts and developers led by Ingo Rübe, CTO for Burda’s German publishing operations, and initiator of Thunder. This team will also be responsible for coordinating the continuous development and enhancement of Thunder. Ingo Rübe explains,“A CMS is no longer a strategic differentiator, especially in the consumer’s perception. Thunder helps media companies break free from expensive legacy systems, and focus on the development of their content and brands.”</p>\r\n"

              value: "<p><strong>Innovative CMS technology enriched by custom features for publishers</strong><br />\r\nThunder is a Drupal distribution based on the new version 8 of the framework, released in November 2015. It features a range of publisher-centric Drupal modules with custom enhancements, including tools for interactive content, IVW counting tools, single sign-on (SSO) and Responsive Web Design (RWD). With RWD, the layout of both the front-end (websites) and the back-end (authoring tool) automatically adjusts to each user’s device. Thunder users also benefit from a whole range of channel- and feature-specific enhancements through collaboration with industry partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burda have already migrated their <em>Playboy</em> and <em>Instyle</em> brands to Thunder. Florian Boitin, Editor-in-Chief of <em>Playboy</em>, remembers: “Over six months ago, we were one of the first brands to integrate Thunder into our editorial workflows, and we are proud to have laid the foundations for something really big. We were able to contribute to the design of Thunder by leveraging our long-standing experience of different CMS platforms. We are now reaping the benefits of further development efforts by the community, both in terms of technology and content.”</p>\r\n"
